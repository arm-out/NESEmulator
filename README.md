# NESEmulator
This is an ongoing passion project of mine to emulate the classic Nintendo Entertainment System console to play some of my favorite games.
The project involved emulating the original G502 chip that was modified for the NES along with the 2C03 PPU.

### Game Compatibilty
Currently, the emulator is able to play all 247 original titles that were programmed using Mapper 0. This includes the original Super Mario Bros, Donkey Kong, Dunk Hunt and many more. As I implement more mappers, the compatibility of the emulator will continue to grow.

### Currently Work In Progress
I am still trying to build the interface with which the Audio Processing Unit (APU) will be able to output sound in real time and thus none of the games at the moment will have sounds (although every other gameplay aspect runs smoothly).
